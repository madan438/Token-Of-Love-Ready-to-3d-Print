# Token-Of-Love-Ready-to-3d-Print
"A token of appreciation designed for 3D printing! ðŸŽ‰ This model consists of three parts: the AMES logo, a special 'Celebrating 10 Years' emblem, and a sturdy base. Designed to commemorate a decade of excellence at the Association of Mechanical Engineering Students (AMES), this piece reflects precision, creativity, and the spirit of innovation.
If you need the CAD file in any format, feel free to message me directly! I'm happy to share and discuss the design. ðŸš¢âœ¨ #CAD #SolidWorks #MechanicalDesign
